# Part two: Running the trial

## Upload the allocation data

Now that you have allocated each patient to either arm A (control) or B (intervention), it is time to run the trial. 

To complete this step, you need a .csv file with the participant data you downloaded in step 1, and a new 'arm' column, showing the arm to which each participant has been allocated (either 'A' or'B').  

Use the 'upload' button to upload your csv file. It should display below, so that you can check all appears in order. Occasionally a CSV file might get saved with a different separator. If this is the case then it should display properly for one of other the separator options.
